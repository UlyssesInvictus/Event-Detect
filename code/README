Welcome to our NLP Email Classifier!

For a brief introduction, you may watch our demo video at http://youtu.be/QZfLtUsi3cA 

To get started:

1. Please set your working directory to /Event-Detect/code

2. Start python

3. import Detect

4. Choose the Set rares option with "1" and enter the file you would like
   to save rares to.

5. Enter the number of rare words you would like, 100 is optimal for our
   included test set. Our default test set is 
   "../data/test_data.xlsx."

6. (Optional) Choose the option "2" to enter learning phase. Enter in the name of
   learning set once more, and enter the name of the rare words file created previously. 
   Then choose option "3" to guess, supplying the name of a guess set and the same rares file.
   Learning sets must be labelled with event IDs, while guess sets do not have to be.
   See "../data/learning_data.xlsx" and "../data/guess_data.xlsx" for examples.

7. We proceed to testing with option "4". Select a testing file,
   input the rare words file once more, and choose the number
   of runs you would like (runs randomly sample from test set to gauge average
   accuracy); we suggest 20-40 runs for the sake of time.

Thank You!
Best,
Frances, Raynor, Jimmy, Daniel
