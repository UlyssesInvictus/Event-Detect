Welcome to our NLP Email Classifier!

For a brief introduction, you may watch our demo video at http://youtu.be/QZfLtUsi3cA 

To get started:

1. Please set your working directory to /Event-Detect/code

2. Start python

3. import Detect

4. Choose the Set rares option with "1" and enter the file you would like
   to save rares to.

5. Enter the number of rare words you would like, 100 is optimal for our
   included learning set. Our default learning set is 
   "../data/learning_data.xlsx"

6. Next choose the option "2" to enter learning phase. Enter in name of
   learning set once more, and enter name of rare words file created previously.

7. We proceed to testing with option "4". Our included testing set is
   "../data/test_data.xlsx". Input rare words file once more, and choose number
   of runs you would like (runs randomly sample from test set to gauge average
   accuracy); we suggest 20-40 runs for the sake of time.

8. Option 3 allows for guessing. Test sets and learning sets must be labelled,
   while guess sets must not. Our guess set is "../data/guess_data.xlsx"

Thank You!
Best,
