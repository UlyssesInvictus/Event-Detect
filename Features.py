"""
Input: arrays of email strings for events and non-events, filename (optional), and number of rare words (optional).
Output: array of relative differences of words. Side-effect of creating a file with rare words line by line. 
Defaults to filename and number if args not passed.
Assumes only one type of category.
Works by concatenating all calls to split_words for both event and non-events, then comparing relative frequencies of each. Sets as rare words the words most distinctive of events.

Input: array of email data and rare words files (optional).
Output: array of metrics.
If no rare words argument passed, defaults to a file. If file doesnâ€™t already exist, prints notice to call set_rares and fails. 
Metrics TBD. Currently set: number of rare words. Boolean for rare word.
